# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a Netflix dataset, aiming to uncover insights about the types of content available on the platform, the directors contributing the most content, content ratings, country contributions, and trends in movie durations. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `show_id`: Unique ID for each show.
- `type`: The type of content (Movie or TV Show).
- `title`: The title of the content.
- `director`: The director(s) of the content.
- `cast`: The main cast of the content.
- `country`: The country or countries where the content was produced.
- `date_added`: The date when the content was added to Netflix.
- `release_year`: The year when the content was released.
- `rating`: The rating of the content (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13).
- `duration`: The duration of the content (in minutes or seasons).
- `listed_in`: The genres/categories the content belongs to.
- `description`: A brief description of the content.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following sections:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and converting data types to ensure accurate analysis.
2. **Distribution of Content Types**: Visualizing the proportion of movies and TV shows on Netflix.
3. **Top 10 Directors**: Identifying directors with the most content on Netflix.
4. **Comparison of Ratings**: Analyzing the distribution of ratings across all content.
5. **Country Contribution**: Visualizing the top countries producing Netflix content and their contributions.
6. **Trend in Average Duration of Movies**: Analyzing how the average duration of movies has changed over the years.
7. **Predicting Future Trends in Movie Duration**: Using historical data to forecast the average movie duration for the next few years.

## Visualizations

The project utilizes various visualizations to present the analysis findings, including:

- Pie charts for distribution of content types and country contributions.
- Bar charts for top directors and country contributions.
- Line plots for trends in movie duration.
